# Predicting-Heart-Disease

Project demonstration Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WXLKS7lV8UwaDC5kD2v8E3uVYob1pPOF/view?usp=sharing

The the system predicts the heart diseases by giving us the information about the prediction of the heart attack in the patients. 
The system is trained using 4 machine learning algorithms  namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes .
The project further classifies the accuracy algorithm and also compares them and gives the best accuracy algorithm. 
Further the project also implements ensemble classifiers. In that two techniques are used namely bagging and boosting
Two boosting techniques are used namely: AdaBoost,Gradient Boosting
